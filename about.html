	<p> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working at the University of Southern California. There I am advised by <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/julia-schwartzman/"> Prof. Julia Schwartzmann. </a> </p>
	
	<p> But I have not always lived near Los Angeles, CA. I earned my PhD in Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology under <a href="https://yunkerlab.gatech.edu"> Prof. Peter Yunker </a> and <a href="https://ratclifflab.biosci.gatech.edu/"> Prof. William Ratcliff </a>. </p>
	
	<p> I grew up in Haddam, Connecticut and I attended Lafayette College (in Easton, PA) for my undergraduate degree in physics.</p>

	<p> While at Lafayette College, I competed in Track & Field and Cross Country and 
	I learned to fall in love with distance running. While my mileage has decreased
	significantly since I've gone to Georgia Tech, I have still found some time to train
	for and run the New York City marathon. Most recently, I have done a serious amount of
	cycling, and I competed in my first criterium race in April 2022.
	</p>

	<p> In my free time I also like to play music. I started on the guitar but I have since acquired a bass, banjo, and some harmonicas.</p>
