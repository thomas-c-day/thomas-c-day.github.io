	<p> I am currently a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology since the 
	summer of 2017. There I am co-advised by <a href="https://yunkerlab.gatech.edu"> Prof. Peter 
	Yunker </a> and <a href="https://ratclifflab.biosci.gatech.edu/"> Prof. William Ratcliff </a>. </p>
	
	<p> But I have not always lived near Atlanta: I grew up in Haddam, Connecticut and I attended Lafayette College (in Easton, PA) for my undergraduate degree in physics.</p>

	<p> While at Lafayette College, I competed in Track & Field and Cross Country and 
	I learned to fall in love with distance running. While my mileage has decreased
	significantly since I've gone to Georgia Tech, I have still found some time to train
	for and run the New York City marathon. Most recently, I joined the club triathlon team, and I competed in my first triathlon in 
	September 2018.</p>

	<p> In my free time I also like to play music. I started on the guitar but I have since acquired a bass, banjo, and some harmonicas.</p>
