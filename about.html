<h> About Me </h>

	<p> I am currently a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology since the 
	summer of 2017. My advisor is <a href="https://yunkerlab.gatech.edu"> Prof. Peter 
	Yunker </a>. </p>
	
	<p> But I haven't always lived in Atlanta! I grew up in Haddam, Connecticut and I 
	attended Lafayette College for my undergraduate degree in physics.</p>

	<p> While at Lafayette College, I competed in Track & Field and Cross Country and 
	I learned to fall in love with distance running. While my mileage has decreased
	significantly since I've gone to Georgia Tech, I have still found some time to train
	for and run the New York City marathon (which was brutal). Most recently, 
	I've joined the club triathlon team, and I competed in my first triathlon in 
	September 2018.</p>

	<p> In my (little remaining) free time I like to play guitar. But for now, most of my effort goes into my research.</p>
