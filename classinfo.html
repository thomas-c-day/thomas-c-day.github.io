<h3> Homework/Project Assignment Descriptions </h3>
	<h4> Homework 01 </h4>
	<p> You are given a gross RGB image from your least favorite labmate (me), but they are hoping that you can help them get usable data out of the image. You realize you need to clean it up, first! Write a usable code that reads the RGB image in, converts it to grayscale, performs 2 additional image filtering mechanisms of your choice, then binarizes the image. You may use any coding language of your choice, and you may use any built-in function of these languages, or, for brownie points, write your own. Your goal is to output from this code a binarized image from which we may obtain measurements. You will submit the code/program text to me such that I may run it on my own computer. </p>
	
	<h4> Homework 02 </h4>
	<p> Your lab partner has taken an SEM photo of some cells and wants to count how many there are and calculate their mean size. Your job is to conduct this image analysis and retrieve these two measurements, returning these two quantities to your labmate. You realize that your best strategy is to filter and binarize the image first, then use binary operations and segmentation techniques to isolate the poppyseeds from the background and from each other. You will submit the input image, the output image, and the code you used to generate the output image. Your code should utilize a binarization function, at least one morphological change (e.g. dilation, erosion, etc.), and a connected components function. Alternative data: you may use a static image of your own experiments in place of my SEM cells image. The requirements are that the image must contain at least 3 items of interest and it must be in grayscale or RGB (i.e. you should not start with an already binary image). </p>
