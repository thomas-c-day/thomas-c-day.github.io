<h3> Snowflake Yeast </h3>
<p> <a href="https://yunkerlab.gatech.edu"> Yunker lab webpage </a> </p>
<p> My recent work has been about exploring the transitionary steps to 
multicellularity. How did the first multicellular organisms arise? What kind of challenges 
did they overcome (especially on new length scales - forces which might tear them apart)?
And how did they evolve intercellular communication, differentiation, and other complex
behaviors that are hallmarks of modern multicellularity? </p>

<p> To help tackle these problems, the Yunker lab uses an experimental multicellular system: lab-evolved
baker's yeast. This is the same kind of yeast you can buy in the grocery store, and furthermore it is also sometimes used in certain beer-brewing processes.
Interestingly, it is fairly easy to evolve multicellular groups of baker's yeast, and this is why our group uses this system.
You can see some of the original papers on this process from the Ratcliff group <a href="https://ratclifflab.biosci.gatech.edu/"> here </a>. 
So far, my labmates and I have published <A href="publications.html">two papers</A> on the emergent 
physics of yeast clusters (and there are more hopefully in the works soon).</p>

<h3> Heart Rate Variability </h3>
<p> During my undergraduate time, I also completed research on a phenomenon known as heart rate variability, or HRV.
The goal of my project was to better predict decreases in heart health based on patient heart rate data.
What I found so cool about that project was that our hypothesis was that no data other than 
heart rate was needed to be able to predict something about heart health! Simply from a
stochastic time series, we could say whether an individual was likely to have atrial fibrillation, 
congestive heart disease, and some other debilitating heart problems.</p>

<p> Work on this project is still ongoing, and eventually I hope to publish work from that project in the Physical Review. Until then, stay tuned for other heart rate measuring devices that predict heart health! They could be using some of the same techniques my advisors and I were trying to further develop. </p>

<div style="max-width:500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
	<img src="hrv-plots.jpg" vspace="3">
	<p2> This image highlights the differences between a multifractal dataset (blue), monofractal
	dataset (green), and white noise (red). The key is that the Hurst exponent H(q) has a broad
	range of values for the multifractal set, indicative of long-range correlation. Such long range
	correlation is a hallmark for healthy hearts, so we expect healthy hearts to have broad multifractal spectra. </p2>
