<h3> Snowflake Yeast </h3>
<p> My recent work has been about exploring the transitionary steps to 
multicellularity. How did the first multicellular organisms arise? What kind of challenges 
did they overcome (especially on new length scales - forces which might tear them apart)?
And how did they evolve intercellular communication, differentiation, and other complex
behaviors? I posit that physics played a huge role in these questions, among many others, in 
the beginnings of complex life on this planet.</p>

<p> To help tackle these problems, I use an experimental multicellular system: lab-evolved
"snowflake" yeast. By starting with a simple and well-known single-celled baker's yeast, 
researchers have found that genetic modifications to multicellularity are easy to control. 
I then take these newly-formed proto-multicellular clusters and run experiments exploring 
the fitness and energy landscapes associated with evolutionary transitions. So far, my 
labmates and I have published two <A href="publications.html">papers</A> on the emergent 
physics of snowflake yeast!</p>

	<p2> Here is a figure from a recent NSF GRFP proposal I wrote. In this image you can
	see some individual yeast cells that have evolved to remain attached to each other,
	forming the cluster see in <strong><em>a</em></strong>. Some of these clusters grow to be <em>huge</em>, like 
	in <strong><em>b</em></strong> and also the inset portion of <strong><em>a</em></strong>. How do they get to be this
	big, overcoming and mitigating internal and external forces? </p2>

<h3> Heart Rate Variability </h3>
<p> During my undergraduate time, I also completed research on a phenomenon known as heart rate variability, or HRV.
The goal of my project was to better predict decreases in heart health based on patient heart rate data.
What I found so cool about that project was that our hypothesis was that no data other than 
heart rate was needed to be able to predict something about heart health! Simply from a
stochastic time series, we could say whether an individual was likely to have atrial fibrillation, 
congestive heart disease, and some other debilitating heart problems.</p>

<p> Work on this project is still ongoing, and eventually I hope to publish work from that project in the Physical Review. Until then, stay tuned for other heart rate measuring devices that predict heart health! They could be using some of the same techniques my advisors and I were trying to further develop. </p>

	<p2> This image highlights the differences between a multifractal dataset (blue), monofractal
	dataset (green), and white noise (red). The key is that the Hurst exponent H(q) has a broad
	range of values for the multifractal set, indicative of long-range correlation. Such long range
	correlation is a hallmark for healthy hearts, so we expect healthy hearts to have broad multifractal spectra. </p2>
